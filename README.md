# Meteor-Visualizations

This site allows users to view an interactive map of meteor and meteorite strikes over the past 1000 years. It also has a second visualization about future probability and harm caused by potential strikes. We mades these visualizations in JavaScript using D3.

The site is currently hosted live on <a href="https://sleepy-stream-67686.herokuapp.com/">Heroku.</a>

This was the final team project for <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP20/class/INFO/3300">CS 3300: Data-Drive Web Applications</a> My teammates were Reggie Ezeh and Leo Tong.
